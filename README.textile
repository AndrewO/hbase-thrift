h1. HBase Thrift

Just the thrift interface and its generated Ruby code.  Maybe some more idiomatic Ruby in the future.

h2. Running HBase

Follow the standard instructions for installing and running the HBase server.  As of version 0.20.0, it appears that the Thrift server needs to be started with:

<pre><code>hbase thrift start</code></pre>

and *not* the hbase-daemon.sh script as indicated in multiple places.

h2. Regenerating the code

There's a rake task to generate the ruby files in gen-rb from the lib/Hbase.thrift.  To regenerate, run:

<pre><code>rake thrift:gen</code></pre>

h2. Version?

To keep things simpler, the version of the gem will always match the version of HBase that the Thrift file came from.
